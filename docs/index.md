A Responsive pagination library can generate pagination like many others. But the main goal is to provide **responsive functionality** for hiding and showing some links according to breakpoints.<br>
Responsivity is fully controlled by **CSS**, so can be used with Bootstrap or any other framework.<br>
It also can be used with any CMS. There is an example with Wordpress, see TODO.
