A Responsive pagination library can generate pagination like many others. But the main goal is to provide **responsive functionality** for hiding and showing some link buttons according to breakpoints.

Responsivity is fully controlled only by your own **CSS classes**, so can be used with Bootstrap, any other framework or custom solution.<br>
It also can be used with any CMS. There is an example with Wordpress.<br>
See [arxeiss.github.io/responsive-pagination](https://arxeiss.github.io/responsive-pagination/).
