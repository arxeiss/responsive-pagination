Responsive pagination library can generate pagination like many others. But the main goal is to provide **responsive functionality** for hiding and showing some links according to breakpoints. Can be used in whatever system. Examples contain also usage in [**Wordpress**](#usage-with-wordpress).
See the screenshot below or check live usage on my blog [kutac.cz/blog](https://www.kutac.cz/blog?strana=7) *(in Czech language)*.
